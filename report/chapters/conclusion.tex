\section*{Conclusion}
At the end of the project it can be said that there are many different atlas based segmentation methods. Majority voting, global weighted voting, local weighted voting and shape based averaging were implemented and analyzed in detail. All atlas based methods perform better than machine learning for the smaller brain regions. However, for brain regions that differ from person to person, such as gray matter, atlas-based methods perform worse. With the locally weighted method, the Dice score can be increased a little, but it cannot reach the performance of machine learning. Besides, it shows that the registration methods do not have a big impact on the final result. Non-rigid registration does not perform better than affine registration. The hypothesis that Atlas based segmentation consists of a powerful baseline for brain tissue segmentation when compared to an ML based approach can be rejected according to the obtained findings. It can be used as a support to improve machine learning. Perhaps by optimizing only the grey and white matter with machine learning.
