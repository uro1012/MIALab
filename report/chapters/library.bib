   abstract = {Background: To make inferences about brain structures or activity across multiple individuals, one first needs to determine the structural correspondences across their image data. We have recently developed Mindboggle as a fully automated, feature-matching approach to assign anatomical labels to cortical structures and activity in human brain MRI data. Label assignment is based on structural correspondences between labeled atlases and unlabeled image data, where an atlas consists of a set of labels manually assigned to a single brain image. In the present work, we study the influence of using variable numbers of individual atlases to nonlinearly label human brain image data. Methods: Each brain image voxel of each of 20 human subjects is assigned a label by each of the remaining 19 atlases using Mindboggle. The most common label is selected and is given a confidence rating based on the number of atlases that assigned that label. The automatically assigned labels for each subject brain are compared with the manual labels for that subject (its atlas). Unlike recent approaches that transform subject data to a labeled, probabilistic atlas space (constructed from a database of atlases), Mindboggle labels a subject by each atlas in a database independently. Results: When Mindboggle labels a human subject's brain image with at least four atlases, the resulting label agreement with coregistered manual labels is significantly higher than when only a single atlas is used. Different numbers of atlases provide significantly higher label agreements for individual brain regions. Conclusions: Increasing the number of reference brains used to automatically label a human subject brain improves labeling accuracy with respect to manually assigned labels. Mindboggle software can provide confidence measures for labels based on probabilistic assignment of labels and could be applied to large databases of brain images. © 2005 Klein et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {It has been shown that employing multiple atlas images improves segmentation accuracy in atlas-based medical image segmentation. Each atlas image is registered to the target image independently and the calculated transformation is applied to the segmentation of the atlas image to obtain a segmented version of the target image. Several independent candidate segmentations result from the process, which must be somehow combined into a single final segmentation. Majority voting is the generally used rule to fuse the segmentations, but more sophisticated methods have also been proposed. In this paper, we show that the use of global weights to ponderate candidate segmentations has a major limitation. As a means to improve segmentation accuracy, we propose the generalized local weighting voting method. Namely, the fusion weights adapt voxel-by-voxel according to a local estimation of segmentation performance. Using digital phantoms and MR images of the human brain, we demonstrate that the performance of each combination technique depends on the gray level contrast characteristics of the segmented region, and that no fusion method yields better results than the others for all the regions. In particular, we show that local combination strategies outperform global methods in segmenting high-contrast structures, while global techniques are less sensitive to noise when contrast between neighboring structures is low. We conclude that, in order to achieve the highest overall segmentation accuracy, the best combination method for each particular structure must be selected. © 2009 IEEE.},

   abstract = {A new method for averaging multidimensional images is presented, which is based on signed Euclidean distance maps computed for each of the pixel values. We refer to the algorithm as “shape-based averaging” (SBA) because of its similarity to Raya and Udupa’s shape-based interpolation method. The new method does not introduce pixel intensities that were not present in the input data, which makes it suitable for averaging nonnumerical data such as label maps (segmentations). Using segmented human brain magnetic resonance images, SBA is compared to label voting for the purpose of averaging image segmentations in a multiclassifier fashion. SBA, on average, performed as well as label voting in terms of recognition rates of the averaged segmentations. SBA produced more regular and contiguous structures with less fragmentation than did label voting. SBA also was more robust for small numbers of atlases and for low atlas resolutions, in particular, when combined with shape-based interpolation. We conclude that SBA improves the contiguity and accuracy of averaged image segmentations.

   abstract = {Label fusion is one of the key steps in multi-atlas based segmentation of structural magnetic resonance (MR) images. Although a number of label fusion methods have been developed in literature, most of those existing methods fail to address two important problems, i.e., (1) compared with boundary voxels, inner voxels usually have higher probability (or reliability) to be correctly segmented, and (2) voxels with high segmentation reliability (after initial segmentation) can help refine the segmentation of voxels with low segmentation reliability in the target image. To this end, we propose a general reliability-based robust label fusion framework for multi-atlas based MR image segmentation. Specifically, in the first step, we perform initial segmentation for MR images using a conventional multi-atlas label fusion method. In the second step, for each voxel in the target image, we define two kinds of reliability, including the label reliability and spatial reliability that are estimated based on the soft label and spatial information from the initial segmentation, respectively. Finally, we employ voxels with high label-spatial reliability to help refine the label fusion process of those with low reliability in the target image. We incorporate our proposed framework into four well-known label fusion methods, including locally-weighted voting (LWV), non-local mean patch-based method (PBM), joint label fusion (JLF) and sparse patch-based method (SPBM), and obtain four novel label-spatial reliability-based label fusion approaches (called ls-LWV, ls-PBM, ls-JLF, and ls-SPBM). We validate the proposed methods in segmenting ROIs of brain MR images from the NIREP, LONI-LPBA40 and ADNI datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our label-spatial reliability-based label fusion methods outperform the state-of-the-art methods in multi-atlas image segmentation.},

   abstract = {Although intensity-based similarity measures are increasingly used for medical image registration, they often rely on implicit assumptions regarding the imaging physics. This paper clarifies the assumptions on which a number of popular similarity measures rely. After formalizing registration based on general image acquisition models, we show that the search for an optimal measure can be cast into a maximum likelihood estimation problem. We then derive similarity measures corresponding to different modeling assumptions and retrieve some well-known measures (correlation coefficient, correlation ratio, mutual information). Finally, we present results of rigid registration between several image modalities to illustrate the importance of choosing an appropriate similarity measure.},

   abstract = {A novel atlas-based segmentation approach based on the combination of multiple registrations is presented. Multiple atlases are registered to a target image. To obtain a segmentation of the target, labels of the atlas images are propagated to it. The propagated labels are combined by spatially varying decision fusion weights. These weights are derived from local assessment of the registration success. Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing atlas-based segmentation approaches, namely 1) single atlas-based segmentation, 2) average-shape atlas-based segmentation, and 3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion. These methods were tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in computed tomography scans of the thorax. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods and yields results very close to those of an independent human observer. Moreover, the additional atlas selection step led to a faster segmentation at a comparable performance. © 2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Interpolation is required in many medical image processing operations. From sampling theory, it follows that the ideal interpolation kernel is the sinc function, which is of infinite extent. In the attempt to obtain practical and computationally efficient image processing algorithms, many sinc-approximating interpolation kernels have been devised. In this paper we present the results of a quantitative comparison of 84 different sinc-approximating kernels, with spatial extents ranging from 2 to 10 grid points in each dimension. The evaluation involves the application of geometrical transformations to medical images from different modalities (CT, MR, and PET), using the different kernels. The results show very clearly that, of all kernels with a spatial extent of 2 grid points, the linear interpolation kernel performs best. Of all kernels with an extent of 4 grid points, the cubic convolution kernel is the best (28% - 75% reduction of the errors as compared to linear interpolation). Even better results (44% - 95% reduction) are obtained with kernels of larger extent, notably the Welch, Cosine, Lanczos, and Kaiser windowed sinc kernels. In general, the truncated sinc kernel is one of the worst performing kernels.},

   abstract = {Normal and abnormal brains can be segmented by registering the target image with an atlas. Here, an atlas is defined as the combination of an intensity image (template) and its segmented image (the atlas labels). After registering the atlas template and the target image, the atlas labels are propagated to the target image. We define this process as atlas-based segmentation. In recent years, researchers have investigated registration algorithms to match atlases to query subjects and also strategies for atlas construction. In this paper we present a review of the automated approaches for atlas-based segmentation of magnetic resonance brain images. We aim to point out the strengths and weaknesses of atlas-based methods and suggest new research directions. We use two different criteria to present the methods. First, we refer to the algorithms according to their atlas-based strategy: label propagation, multi-atlas methods, and probabilistic techniques. Subsequently, we classify the methods according to their medical target: the brain and its internal structures, tissue segmentation in healthy subjects, tissue segmentation in fetus, neonates and elderly subjects, and segmentation of damaged brains. A quantitative comparison of the results reported in the literature is also presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},
