abstract = {Background: Surface texture of a breast implant influences tissue response and ultimately device performance. Characterizing differences among available surface textures is important for predicting and optimizing performance. Methods: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (CT)-imaging were used to characterize the topography and surface area of 12 unique breast implant surface textures from seven different manufacturers. Samples of these surface textures were implanted in rats, and tissue response was analyzed histologically. In separate experiments, the force required to separate host tissue from the implant surface texture was used as a measure of tissue adherence. Results: SEM imaging of the top and cross section of the implant shells showed that the textures differed qualitatively in evenness of the surface, presence of pores, size and openness of the pores, and the depth of texturing. X-ray CT imaging reflected these differences, with the texture surface area of the anterior of the shells ranging from 85 to 551 mm2, which was 8–602{\%} greater than that of a flat surface. General similarities based on the physical structure of the surfaces were noted among groups of textures. In the rat models, with increasing surface texture complexity, there was increased capsule disorganization, tissue ingrowth, and tissue adherence. Conclusions: Surface area and topography of breast implant textures are important factors contributing to tissue ingrowth and adherence. Based on surface area characteristics and measurements, it is possible to group the textures into four classifications: smooth/nanotexture (80–100 mm2), microtexture (100–200 mm2), macrotexture (200–300 mm2), and macrotexture-plus ({\textgreater} 300 mm2).},

abstract = {Purpose Increasing numbers of women undergo breast implantation for cosmetic and reconstructive purposes. Contracture of the fibrous capsule, which encases the implant leads to significant pain and reoperation. Texture, wettability and the cellular reaction to implant surfaces are poorly understood determinants of implant biocompatibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro characteristics of a range of commercial available implants using a macrophage based assay of implant biocompatibility and a quantitative assessment of wettability and texture. Methods Thirteen commercially available surfaces were subjected to wettability and texture characterisation using scanning and laser confocal microscopy. THP-1 macrophages were cultured on their surfaces and assessed using Integrin $\alpha$V immunocytochemistry, SEM and RT-PCR for the expression of TNF-Alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and a cytokine array for the production of TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-1RA and IL1$\beta$; important indicators of inflammation and macrophage polarization. Results Textured surfaces can be accurately sub-categorized dependent upon roughness and re-entrant features into four main types (macro, micro, meso and nano-textured surfaces). Significant (P {\textless} 0.0001) differences in implant hydrophobicity and texture exist. Certain surfaces promoted poor macrophage polarization and an innate potential to foster a proinflammatory response. A subgroup analysis showed that texture had a variable effect on markers of inflammation in these surfaces. Conclusions We propose a classification of implant surfaces based on roughness and present a macrophage based assay of breast implant biocompatibility with a quantitative assessment of implant wettability and texture. The breast implant surface-cell interaction is variable and sufficient to alter healing response and capsular contracture fate in-vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Capsular contracture is a common complication associated with the use of breast implants. Numerous randomized controlled trials addressing the efficacy of textured surface breast implants in reducing capsular contracture have yielded nonuniform results. This meta-analysis addresses the use of textured breast implants in the prevention of capsular contracture. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched to identify all randomized controlled trials involving the use of textured versus smooth breast implants. The results of these trials were meta-analyzed to obtain a pooled odds ratio of the effect of textured surfacing on capsular contracture rates. In addition, subgroup analyses were performed based on implant type (saline or silicone gel), type of surface texturing (Siltex or Biocell), placement (subglandular or submuscular), and length of follow-up. RESULTS: Eleven trials were reviewed. Four were excluded because they failed to meet a priori inclusion criteria. The remaining seven trials were meta-analyzed. Only three of these studies found significantly lower rates of capsular contracture with the use of textured implants. However, when all seven studies were pooled, the odds ratio was found to be 0.19 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.52), indicating a protective effect for surface texturing on the rate of capsular contracture. Submuscular placement was the only subgroup in which significance was not achieved. However, this subgroup consisted of a single study, which was dramatically underpowered. CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis demonstrate the superiority of textured over smooth breast implants in decreasing the rate of capsular contracture.

abstract = {The IDEAL IMPLANT{\textregistered} Structured Breast Implant is a dual lumen saline-filled implant with capsular contracture and deflation/rupture rates much lower than single-lumen silicone gel-filled implants. To better understand the implant's mechanical properties and to provide a potential explanation for these eight-year clinical results, a novel approach to compressive load testing was employed. Multi-dimensional strains and tangent moduli, metrics describing the shape stability of the total implant, were derived from the experimental load and platen spacing data. The IDEAL IMPLANT was found to have projection, diametric, and areal strains that were generally less than silicone gel implants, and tangent moduli that were generally greater than silicone gel implants. Despite having a relatively inviscid saline fill, the IDEAL IMPLANT was found to be more shape stable compared to gel implants, which implies potentially less interaction with the capsule wall when the implant is subjected to compressive loads. Under compressive loads, the shape stability of a higher cross-link density, cohesive gel implant was unexpectedly found to be similar to or the same as a gel implant. In localized diametric compression testing, the IDEAL IMPLANT was found to have a palpability similar to a gel implant, but softer than a cohesive gel implant.},

abstract = {Objective: Although clinical reports have raised concern that breast implants may either increase the risk of breast cancer or delay its diagnosis, epidemiologic studies have generally shown implant recipients to be at a reduced risk of subsequent breast cancer. A large retrospective cohort study was undertaken to clarify effects of cosmetic breast implantation. Methods: Medical records of 13,488 women receiving cosmetic implants at 18 plastic surgery practices and a group of 3936 patients who received other types of plastic surgery at the same practices were reviewed and information abstracted. Questionnaires were sent to all subjects located as alive, with 71{\%} being completed. Attempts were made to obtain medical verification for all reported cancers and to obtain death certificates for deceased subjects. Results: A total of 136 breast cancers were observed among the breast implant patients. External analyses, using general population rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, resulted in 152.2 cases expected and a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 0.9 (95{\%} CI 0.8-1.1). A comparable SIR was found for the other plastic surgery patients (SIR = 1.0, 95{\%} CI 0.7-1.2). Internal analyses, directly comparing the implant patients with the other plastic surgery patients, showed a RR of 0.8 (95{\%} CI 0.6-1.1). In neither the external nor internal analyses was there any systematic variation in risk by age or calendar year of initial implant. Risk also did not vary by years of follow-up or by type of implant. Risk was not affected by exclusion of patients who received their implants following surgery for benign breast disease. Although breast tumors tended to be detected at a somewhat later stage among the breast implant than the comparison patients, the difference was not statistically significant, nor was there any significant difference in breast cancer mortality between the two groups. Conclusions: Breast implants do not appear to alter the risk of subsequent breast cancer. Introduction},

abstract = {Background: Capsular contracture remains one of the major complications after breast implantation surgery. The extent of capsular contraction is scored using the Baker scale. The aim of this study was to compare intra-individual Baker-I with Baker-IV capsules, and in particular the prevalence and histological properties of the inner capsule layer. Methods: Twenty capsules from ten patients were included after bilateral explantation surgery due to unilateral capsular contracture (Baker-IV) after cosmetic augmentation with textured implants. All capsules underwent (immune-)histochemical analysis: haematoxylin–eosin (morphology), CD68 (macrophages), cytokeratin (epithelial cells) and vimentin (fibroblasts), and were visually scored for cell density and the presence of an inner layer and measured for thickness. Results: Baker-IV (n = 10) capsules were significantly thicker compared to Baker-I (n = 10) capsules (P = 0.004). An inner layer was present in 8 Baker-I capsules. All Baker-I capsules were vimentin and CD68-positive and cytokeratin-negative. Positive vimentin was seen throughout the inner layer, and CD-68 staining was observed adjacent to the intermediate capsule layer. In contrast, only 2 Baker-IV capsules had an inner layer, of which only 1 showed the same profile as Baker-I capsules (P = 0.016). No cytokeratin positivity was seen in any capsule. In Baker-IV capsules, outer layers showed more positivity for both vimentin and CD68. Conclusion: The inner layer is morphologically consistent with synovial metaplasia and is more prevalent in healthy, uncontracted Baker-I capsules. This inverse relation between the presence of the inner layer and higher Baker classification or pathological contracture could indicate a protective role of the inner layer against capsular contracture formation.

abstract = {Most commercially available breast implants feature some degree of elas- tomer surface modifications to increase surface roughness, in part because several clinical series have demonstrated positive outcomes from texturizing. However, the literature shows that textured implants support higher rates of bacterial growth, and there is a clear association between increased bacterial contamination and host response in vivo, such as capsular contracture. Furthermore, the infectious theory related to bacterial contamination has recently been described as a poten- tial cause in the etiology of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Recent research has focused on the physiology of breast implant surfaces advances and how they inter- act with the body, creating new surface technologies which have the potential to affect all aspects of breast surgery. Understanding how surface properties affect inflammatory cell response will be essential in designing implants that can provide an esthetic solution while also minimizing long-term clinical complications.

abstract = {Purpose: Regional disparities in breast cancer outcomes have been reported in Switzerland. The purpose of this study is to investigate geographic variation in early diagnosis and management of breast cancer. Methods: We used data from a representative sample of 4820 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005 identified by seven Swiss population based cancer registries. We collected retrospectively detailed information on mode of detection, tumor characteristics and treatments. Differences across geographic regions were tested for statistical significance using chi-square tests and uni- and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Considerable disparities in early detection and management of early breast cancer were found across regions. In particular, the proportion of early detected cancer varied from 43{\%} in Valais to 27{\%} in St. Gallen-Appenzell. Mastectomy rates varied from 24{\%} in Geneva to 38{\%} in St. Gallen-Appenzell and Grisons-Glarus. Higher reconstruction rates were observed in regions with lower rates of mastectomy. The use of sentinel node procedure in patients with nodal negative disease was high in Geneva and low in Eastern Switzerland. Differences in compliance with recommendations on the use of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy were less pronounced but statistically significant. Conclusions: This analysis shows considerable geographic variation in breast cancer care in a health system characterized by high expenditures, universal access to services and high decentralization. Further study into the causes and effects of this variation on short- and long term patient outcomes is needed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose: Breast implant-associated anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a recently described clinicopathologic entity that usually presents as an effusion-associated fibrous capsule surrounding an implant. Less frequently, it presents as a mass. The natural history of this disease and long-term outcomes are unknown. Patients and Methods: We reviewed the literature for all published cases of breast implant-associated ALCL from 1997 to December 2012 and contacted corresponding authors to update clinical follow-up. Results: The median overall survival (OS) for 60 patients was 12 years (median follow-up, 2 years; range, 0-14 years). Capsulectomy and implant removal was performed on 56 of 60 patients (93{\%}). Therapeutic data were available for 55 patients: 39 patients (78{\%}) received systemic chemotherapy, and of the 16 patients (28{\%}) who did not receive chemotherapy, 12 patients opted for watchful waiting and four patients received radiation therapy alone. Thirty-nine (93{\%}) of 42 patients with disease confined by the fibrous capsule achieved complete remission, compared with complete remission in 13 (72{\%}) of 18 patients with a tumor mass. Patients with a breast mass had worse OS and progression-free survival (PFS; P = .052 and P = .03, respectively). The OS or PFS were similar between patients who received and did not receive chemotherapy (P = .44 and P = .28, respectively). Conclusion: Most patients with breast implant-associated ALCL who had disease confined within the fibrous capsule achieved complete remission. Proper management for these patients may be limited to capsulectomy and implant removal. Patients who present with a mass have a more aggressive clinical course that may be fatal, justifying cytotoxic chemotherapy in addition to removal of implants. {\textcopyright} 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Background: The association between breast implants and breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has been confirmed. Implant-related risk has been difficult to estimate to date due to incomplete datasets. Methods: All cases in Australia and New Zealand were identified and analyzed. Textured implants reported in this group were subjected to surface area analysis. Sales data from three leading breast implant manufacturers (i.e., Mentor, Allergan, and Silimed) dating back to 1999 were secured to estimate implant-specific risk. Results: Fifty-five cases of breast implant-associated ALCL were diagnosed in Australia and New Zealand between 2007 and 2016. The mean age of patients was 47.1 years and the mean time of implant exposure was 7.46 years. There were four deaths in the series related to mass and/or metastatic presentation. All patients were exposed to textured implants. Surface area analysis confirmed that higher surface area was associated with 64 of the 75 implants used (85.3 percent). Biocell salt loss textured (Allergan, Inamed, and McGhan) implants accounted for 58.7 percent of the implants used in this series. Comparative analysis showed the risk of developing breast implant-associated ALCL to be 14.11 times higher with Biocell textured implants and 10.84 higher with polyurethane (Silimed) textured implants compared with Siltex textured implants. Conclusions: This study has calculated implant-specific risk of breast implant- associated ALCL. Higher-surface-area textured implants have been shown to significantly increase the risk of breast implant-associated ALCL in Australia and New Zealand.
