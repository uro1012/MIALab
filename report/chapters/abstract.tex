Medical image analysis usually uses atlas-based methods to segment brain tissues. Machine learning based methods could replace those older ones in the near future. Both types of segmentation have been compared, as well as the influence of affine or non-rigid registration before-hand. Only five tissues of the brain have been been segmented with 20 training images and 10 test images. The results are compared with the Dice score and Hausdorff distance.

Atlas-based segmentations give better results with smaller brain parts (amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus). Geometrically complex parts (grey and white matter) have better results when segmented with a machine learning method. The best overall solution is obtained with a locally weighted atlas-based segmentation.
